const exportInstructions = `### INSTRUCTIONS ###
Each "Short:" section represents a complete, standalone short-form video narrative.

üìå These will be used for social media, so:
- Each "Short:" must tell a full mini-story or idea on its own.
- Do NOT just group similar topics ‚Äî create compelling narratives.
- You may reuse lines across Shorts if needed for clarity or punchline.

‚úÖ You MAY:
- Reorder full transcript lines
- Delete any lines or Shorts
- Duplicate lines across different Shorts (if needed for clarity)

‚ùå You MUST NOT:
- Modify any text content or timestamps
- Split or edit inside a line
- Change the format

--- FORMAT RULES ---

Each section must begin with:
Short: [Your custom short title]

Each line must follow this format:
[STARTs‚ÄìENDs] transcript text

--- EXAMPLE ---

Short: Teaser Opener
[0s‚Äì6s] Now that my room has been scanned into Blender, this enables the US government to know exactly
[6s‚Äì9s] what color my sheets are.

Short: Build Process
[9s‚Äì16s] We can now start to build the actual track.
[16s‚Äì19s] For this track I want to keep it very simple.

‚ö†Ô∏è DO NOT modify punctuation, wording, or timestamps in the transcript lines.
‚ö†Ô∏è DO NOT format lines differently.
‚ö†Ô∏è ONLY reorder, remove, or duplicate entire lines as-is.
